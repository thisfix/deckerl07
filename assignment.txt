Assignment 7: Error Handling


This assignment will require the development of a specialized exception class and a class that throw this exception. 

Description Create a new Eclipse project, LastNameFirst07. Four classes will need to be implemented, DiscountException, 
Item, InvoiceItem, and Invoice. Additionally, a JUnit test will be required for the Invoice, this test should verify the 
required exceptions are thrown when appropriate. 

DiscountException A specialized exception class. This class defines one new property, the InvoiceItem that caused the 
exception to be thrown.

Item Represents an item that is maintained in the inventory and available for sale. The Item is immutable and has three properties:

Description, a discription of the item
Price, the item's prices (in cents)
Stock keeping unit (SKU), an numeric identifier for the item.
InvoiceItem Represents an item on an invoice. The InvoiceItem is immutable and has the following properties:

Item, the item
Quantity, the quanity of the item being purchased
Discount, the discount (percentage) given on this particular item
The InvoiceItem class also provides methods for getting the total value of the item (quantity * price), 
the total discount (quantity * price * discount), and the net value of the item. 

Invoice The Invoice is a collection of InvoiceItems. Methods must be provided to:

Add and remove InvoiceItems. An attempt to add a null item should raise an IllegalArgumentException.
Set and get the invoice discount, a discount applied to the invoice as a whole. An attempt to set the discount to a 
negative value should raise an IllegalArgumentException.
Process the invoice, prints the invoice. Additionally, it is invalid for an invoice to have both item discounts and an 
invoice discount, this method should detect this and throw a DiscountException.
InvoiceTest The invoice test should verify that the proper exceptions are thrown at the proper times. 

Questions What would the last regular assignment be without questions? Answer the following questions and place in answer.txt 
The answer.txt file should be created in the project src directory. What was experiences using Eclipse or your tool of choice 
for performing the assignments. 

What to turn in Use the eclipse File->Export->Archive file menu to export the project as a zip file. 
Submit this file per the assignment submission instructions.
